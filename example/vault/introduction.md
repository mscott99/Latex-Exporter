hello
## The good part of the good intro
We *have* **things** "to" talk about. We can use macros: $\aff(T)$. Feel free to skip ahead to [[longform_note#Main results]]. This is the actual intro. We will show that [[theorem_1]] holds by using [[lemma_1]], [[lemma_2]], [[other_small_lemmas#First other lemma]] and [[other_small_lemmas#Second other lemma]]. We state one here
lemma::![[other_small_lemmas#Second other lemma]]
