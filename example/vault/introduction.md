# Good intro
hello
## The good part of the good intro
We *have* **things** "to" talk about. We can use latex macros: $\aff(T)$. We can reference markdown headers, which become references to latex sections: feel free to skip ahead to [[longform_note#Main results]].

Results are referenced by linking notes: we will show that [[theorem_1]] holds by using [[lemma_1]], [[lemma_2]], [[other_small_lemmas#First other lemma]] and [[other_small_lemmas#Second other lemma]]. We can state results through labelled embeds, as follows. 
lemma::![[other_small_lemmas#Second other lemma]]
Note that the above result was embedded into the note 'introduction' which was itself embedded into the longform note, and this still produces a result that can be referenced from anywhere via wikilinks.
## Other header
Here is more content which will not be included because it is not embedded.
